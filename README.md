Once you executed the goal of each plugin.

```yaml
      uses: tupac-rocher/mvn-student-friendly-report@v2.1
      with:
        jacoco-html-report: ${{ github.workspace }}/target/site/jacoco/index.html
        ck-main-class-csv: ${{ github.workspace }}/src/main/java/class.csv
        metrics-xml: ${{ github.workspace }}/metrics.xml
        checkstyle-result-xml: ${{ github.workspace }}/target/checkstyle-result.xml
        designite-design-result-csv: ${{ github.workspace }}/target/designite/designCodeSmells.csv

```

## Student-friendly pipeline explanation and context of use
[Report Documentation](https://github.com/tupac-rocher/student-friendly-pipeline-documentation)

Your project should include 2 Maven plugins in the build tag of the pom.xml file:
- jacoco-maven-plugin (verion: 0.8.7, group-id: org.jacoco)
- maven-checkstyle-plugin (version: 3.1.2, group-id: org.apache.maven.plugins)

The pipeline is divided into 3 jobs:
- test
- upload-designite-artifact
- report

### test
**actions used**: actions/checkout@v3, actions/setup-java@v3

**description**: 

The purpose of this job is to test the Maven project to let the user know if the test validation passes before doing the other jobs

### upload-designite-artifact
**actions used**: GuillaumeFalourd/clone-github-repo-action@v2, actions/upload-artifact@v3

**description**:

The purpose of this job is to upload the designite jar to execute the tool in the last job

### report
**actions used**: actions/checkout@v3, actions/setup-java@v3, actions/download-artifact@v3, robinraju/release-downloader@v1.4, montudor/action-zip@v1, tupac-rocher/mvn-student-friendly-report@v2.1, thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v1

**description**: 

This job is the core of the pipeline. It will execute the Maven goals of the Maven plugins (jacoco-maven-plugin, maven-checkstyle-plugin) in order to generate the analytic files. 

It will download the Designite exectuable artifact and execute it against the project to generate the analytic files.

Regarding the metrics, to use CK it will clone its repository, since it is a Maven project it will install it, and finally execute its goal on the current project, this process is due to the way depicted by the CK README file to use the tool, eventually the analytic files are generated. 
To use the JaSoMe tool, the process is to download the release, unzip it and execute it against the project to generate the analytic files.

Now that all the files have been generated. The action corresponding to this repository will be used to aggregate and format the information into a single output that will represent a report in a Markdown formatted String variable.

The Markdown formatted String is used with an action that will comment the pull request.
